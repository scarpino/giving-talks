## Thoughts on giving [scientific] presentations 
Samuel V. Scarpino  

As a part of the Santa Fe Institute's Research Experience for Undergraduates program, I prepared a short lecture on giving scientific talks.  Personally, I think there is far more dogma than science when it comes to giving good presentations.  I also know that we all sit through FAR too many [terrible] talks.  Luckily, some people do consistently give great presentations [ht].  I also benefited immensely from two workshops with LeeAundra Keany.  What follows are my thoughts on what they often do, which others often don't.  I'd love to hear your feedback.  

### High-level
1. Never go over time.
2. Don't finish too early.
3. Know your audience, e.g. is the person who wrote one your intro papers in the room?
4. Show up early enough to test and make necessary modifications. 
5. Friends don't let friends give bad talks, so if you see something, say something.
6. It's ok to be nervous, but giving talks should eventually be enjoyable.
7. Someone in your audience will notice bad fonts, colors, labels, etc.
8. Use the pointer sparingly, especially if you're nervous. [citation - LeeAundra Keany]
9. Get advice on body language and hand movements from an expert.

### Lower-level
* Get and stay organized
	* Assume that you are going to give the talk more than once.
	* Assume you will want to use slides and/or figures in later talks.
* Be platform agnostic
	* Ideally always be satisfied giving your talk from a PDF.
* Figures should be BIG & SIMPLE & COLOR BLIND AWARE.
	* Published figures are almost never ok to use in a talk [citation - Sara Sawyer].
	* Try to follow best practices for reproducibility, i.e. avoid substantial figure modification in programs like Illustrator.  
	* Spend some time making high-quality graphics/cartoons to illustrate key aspects of your talk.
* Text
	* Keep to a minimum and ALWAYS read text out loud.
	* However, use text when you need it.  
		* I like to think of excess text as training wheels, which I slowly remove as I get more comfortable with a talk.  
* First slide
	* Tell us who you are and how to contact you.
	* The title is just for wayward talk attendees.
* Introduction
	* Tell us the story.  
	* Tell us why this is such an exciting research question.
	* Be creative, preparing the intro should be the most rewarding experience of talk prep.
* Equations
	* Usually aren't needed and you'll know when they are.
	* You have to explain and define all equations, think of them as text.
* Results
	* Simple figures.
	* Provide citations for your work and others.
	* Make sure all figure elements are essential.  If they aren't essential then simplify your figures.
* Conclusions
	* Restate your conclusions using images/figures [citation - Mark Kirkpatrick].
* Acknowledge those who contributed
	* Most people like to hear their name, especially if they're in the room.
* Last slide
	* Tell us who you are and how we can contact you.
	* Never have a blank slide with the word "Questions?"
* Questions
	* Hold slides in reserve for the Q/A.  
		* These slides are a great place for equations and/or more complicated figures.
	* It's ok to punt a question until after the talk, i.e. you usually don't have to answer everything thrown your way.
* Practice.
	* There is no one right way to practice, but find yours and do it.
	* If you have a mentor and they're good at giving talks, make sure and get their advice.
